		<p>The impious maintain that nonsense is normal in the Library and that the</br>reasonable (and even humble and pure coherence) is an almost miraculous</br>exception. They speak (I know) of the "feverish Library whose chance volumes</br>are constantly in danger of changing into others and affirm, negate and confuse</br>everything like a delirious divinity." These words, which not only denounce the</br>disorder but exemplify it as well, notoriously prove their authors' abominable</br>taste and desperate ignorance. In truth, the Library includes all verbal structures,</br>all variations permitted by the twenty-five orthographical symbols, but not a single</br>example of absolute nonsense. It is useless to observe that the best</br>volume of the many hexagons under my administration is entitled The Combed</br>Thunderclap and another The Plaster Cramp and another Axaxaxas mlo.</p>

		<p>These phrases, at first glance incoherent, can no</br>doubt be justified in a cryptographical or</br>allegorical manner; such a justification is verbal</br>and, ex hypothesi, already figures in the Library.</br>I cannot combine some characters which the</br>divine Library has not foreseen and which in one</br>of its secret tongues do not contain a terrible</br>meaning. No one can articulate a syllable which</br>is not filled with tenderness and fear, which is</br>not, in one of these languages, the powerful</br>name of a god. To speak is to fall into tautology.</p>
