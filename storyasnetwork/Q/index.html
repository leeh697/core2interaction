		<p>We also know of another superstition of that time: that of the Man of the Book. On some shelf in</br>some hexagon (men reasoned) there must exist a book which is the formula and perfect</br>compendium of all the rest: some librarian has gone through it and he is analogous to a god. In</br>the language of this zone vestiges of this remote functionary's cult still persist. Many wandered</br>in search of Him. For a century they have exhausted in vain the most varied areas. How could one</br>locate the venerated and secret hexagon which housed Him? Someone proposed a regressive</br>method: To locate book A, consult first book B which indicates A's position; to locate book B,</br>consult first a book C, and so on to infinity... In adventures such as these, I have squandered and</br>wasted my years. It does not seem unlikely to me that there is a total book on some shelf of</br>the universe 3 ; I pray to the unknown gods that a man - just one, even though it were thousands of</br>years ago! - may have examined and read it. If honor and wisdom and happiness are not for me,</br>let them be for others. Let heaven exist, though my place be in hell. Let me be outraged and</br>annihilated, but for one instant, in one being, let Your enormous Library be justified.</p>
